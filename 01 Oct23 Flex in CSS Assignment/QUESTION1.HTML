    <H1>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLEX&GRID</H1>
    <P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Flex is designed for layout in one dimension, either a row or a column, while grid is designed for layout in two dimensions, rows and columns at the same time.</LI>
        <LI>Flex uses relative positioning and margins to adjust the layout to fit the content, while grid uses numerical coordinates to position the elements in a strict manner.</LI>
        <LI>Flex is more suitable for small-scale layouts and components that are linear, while grid is more suitable for large-scale layouts that are not linear.</LI>
        <LI>We Can Use Flex  While Creating Nav Bars, Headings ETC. We Can Use GRID WHILE Creating Galleries AND Forms ETC.</LI>
